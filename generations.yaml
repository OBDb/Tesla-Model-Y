    description: "The Tesla Model Y represents the company's entry into the compact crossover segment, sharing approximately 75% of its components with the Model 3 sedan but featuring a taller body, increased cargo space, and optional third-row seating. Utilizing a design philosophy that CEO Elon Musk described as 'an SUV built around the Model 3 chassis,' the Model Y maintains Tesla's minimalist exterior aesthetic with clean lines, a panoramic glass roof, and a distinctive lack of traditional grille, while its higher stance and liftgate configuration make it instantly recognizable from its sedan sibling. Initially launched with dual-motor all-wheel drive in Long Range and Performance configurations, the lineup later expanded to include a more affordable Standard Range rear-wheel drive variant before that model was discontinued and subsequently reintroduced as simply 'Model Y RWD' with updated battery chemistry. Range varies from approximately 279 to 330 miles depending on configuration and model year, with Performance variants capable of 0-60 mph acceleration in as little as 3.5 seconds. The interior mirrors the Model 3's ultra-minimalist approach with nearly all functions controlled through a central 15-inch landscape-oriented touchscreen, though the Model Y offers significantly more cargo capacity—up to 76 cubic feet with rear seats folded—and a higher seating position preferred by many consumers. Production innovation has been a key focus for the Model Y, incorporating Tesla's structural battery pack with 4680 cells in some variants and being the first Tesla vehicle to use massive single-piece front and rear castings that replace dozens of separately stamped parts, significantly reducing manufacturing complexity. Regular over-the-air software updates have continuously enhanced the vehicle's functionality, from improved Autopilot driving assistance to expanded entertainment options and even increased power and efficiency in some updates. As Tesla's most affordable crossover, the Model Y quickly became the company's best-selling model globally and one of the world's best-selling electric vehicles, demonstrating the market's preference for SUV-like vehicles even in the electric segment."
